** Copying/compacting collection

*** During mark phase
  After determininig an object is live (reached ALLOCATED object),
move it towards the beginning of the slab.  Record the new object
position in the old place and set the state of the object (in
``slab->ctl'' array) to MOVED.  When reached a MOVED object, update
the pointer to point to the new location. At the end of the mark phase
all live pointers will be adjusted thusly.

*** During sweep phase
  When scanning slabs and reached a MOVED object change the state to
  NOT-ALLOCATED.

*** Problems
**** How do we find the new posittion to move the object to.
